  Todo:

1. Need time passed resource added
2. Robot model stays when not being a robot anymore (fixed by changing class)
3. When mode is over, robots return to normal
4. Unset robot command
5. Both teams have robot mode
6. Lower robot ratio.
1 - 3 Humans = 1 robot
4 - 6 Humans = 2 robots
7 - 9 Humans = 3 robots
10 - 12 humans = 4 robots
13 - 15 = 5 robots
16 - 18 = 6 robots 

Every 4 player is one robot, rounding to floor.

Make selection mode happen when MM_ENABLE 1 is on after waiting for players is over.

 OnMapStart precaches
extract robot_factory / robot_assembly
  unify 
   setting attributes etc.
storage:
 - turn target into targetlist in storage plugin? ... maybe? 
   needed in command too so it would be duplicate code
     unless command gets setup in main-plugin too?
