  Top Priority:
  1. Fix Memory Leak in volunteers
  Priority:
  2. Use players numbers for players present in a team, not players connecting.
  3. Turn players into a random robot when first joining the robot team.
  4. New robot menu

1. Need time passed resource added (opposite of time remaining)
 Type A- Resource for X amount of time passed, is available after X amount of time has passed
 Type B - Resource for Y amount of time passed in a loop. Becomes unavailable when picked, and only available once Y amount of time has passed again
Example A: Pan Cop becomes available after 180 seconds of gametime has passed, can be picked again
Example B: Gotham Protector becomes available after 60 seconds of gametime, but can't be picked until another 60 seconds has passed after his death or switching of robot.

3. Both teams have robot mode
  1. Robot menu is grayed out when reverting back from paid robot.
  3. New robot menu

Every 4 player is one robot, rounding to floor. (better scaling sometimes?)


Rework menus:
Menu
-> Select free robot
   Select Robot Type
   -> Tank (1) (displays amount of total available robots, unavailable robots are whited out like normal)
      Tanks
           -> Heavy: Bearded
   -> Damage (16)
      Damage
         -> Soldier: Icebear
         -> Demoman: Solarlight
           etc..
   -> Support (6)
         Support
          - Medic: Array Seven
    ... etc
-> Buy one-time robot
   -> Tank (1)
       Tank
         -> Heavy: Pancop
   -> Damage (16)
   -> Support (6)
   -> ZBOSS (3)



Sometimes a player will be on the robot team when not a robot, tied to client stuff.
Unset robots on autoteam balance
Failsafe on robot team
Failsafe on counter going below 0


unify sounds
 OnMapStart precaches
extract robot_factory / robot_assembly
  unify 
   setting attributes etc.
storage:
 - turn target into targetlist in storage plugin? ... maybe? 
   needed in command too so it would be duplicate code
     unless command gets setup in main-plugin too?

codestyles
 .editorconfig
  tab vs spaces
