  Todo:

  Priority:
  1. Robot menu is grayed out when reverting back from paid robot.
  2. Turn players into a random robot when first joining the robot team.
  3. New robot menu

1. Need time passed resource added
2. Robot model stays when not being a robot anymore (fixed by changing class)
3. When mode is over, robots return to normal
4. Both teams have robot mode
Every 4 player is one robot, rounding to floor.

7. Add mvm_start_wave.wav to the beginning of a round.

Rework menus:
Menu
-> Select free robot
   Select Robot Type
   -> Tank (1) (displays amount of total available robots, unavailable robots are whited out like normal)
      Tanks
           -> Heavy: Bearded
   -> Damage (16)
      Damage
         -> Soldier: Icebear
         -> Demoman: Solarlight
           etc..
   -> Support (6)
         Support
          - Medic: Array Seven
    ... etc
-> Buy one-time robot
   -> Tank (1)
       Tank
         -> Heavy: Pancop
   -> Damage (16)
   -> Support (6)
   -> ZBOSS (3)


BUGS:
When reverting, the robot isn't grayed out in the menu, allowing players to de-robofy themselves if selecting the one they got reverted back to.

Sometimes a player will be on the robot team when not a robot, tied to client stuff.
Unset robots on autoteam balance
Failsafe on robot team
Failsafe on counter going below 0


unify sounds
 OnMapStart precaches
extract robot_factory / robot_assembly
  unify 
   setting attributes etc.
storage:
 - turn target into targetlist in storage plugin? ... maybe? 
   needed in command too so it would be duplicate code
     unless command gets setup in main-plugin too?
