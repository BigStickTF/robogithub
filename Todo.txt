  Priority:
  1. Turn players into a random robot when first joining the robot team. Players sometimes don't get turned in to robts
  2. Use players numbers for players present in a team, not players connecting.
  

1. Need time passed resource added (opposite of time remaining)
 Type A- Resource for X amount of time passed, is available after X amount of time has passed
 Type B - Resource for Y amount of time passed in a loop. Becomes unavailable when picked, and only available once Y amount of time has passed again
Example A: Pan Cop becomes available after 180 seconds of gametime has passed, can be picked again
Example B: Gotham Protector becomes available after 60 seconds of gametime, but can't be picked until another 60 seconds has passed after his death or switching of robot.

3. Both teams have robot mode
  1. Robot menu is grayed out when reverting back from paid robot.

Every 4 player is one robot, rounding to floor. (better scaling sometimes?)



Bugs:
Become Human Robot:
1. Volunteer and get selected as robot
2. Retry in console
3. Volunteer - You now become robot on human team.
4. Volunteer again, you now get moved to the correct team.

storage:
 - turn target into targetlist in storage plugin? ... maybe? 
   needed in command too so it would be duplicate code
     unless command gets setup in main-plugin too?
