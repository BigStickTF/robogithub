  2. Use players numbers for players present in a team, not players connecting.
  3. Turn players into a random robot when first joining the robot team.
  4. New robot menu

1. Need time passed resource added
2. When mode is over, robots return to normal

Every 4 player is one robot, rounding to floor.

Sometimes a player will be on the robot team when not a robot, tied to client stuff.
Unset robots on autoteam balance

unify sounds
 OnMapStart precaches
extract robot_factory / robot_assembly
  unify 
   setting attributes etc.

 - turn target into targetlist in storage plugin? ... maybe? 
   needed in command too so it would be duplicate code
     unless command gets setup in main-plugin too?
